# STEGANOGRAPHY_IMAGE_VIDEO

# Overview

Consider a situation where a reporter needs to send some secret message to a news studio or a soldier needs to pass some secret information to the base. One way they can do this is by concealing the message within a non-secret Image or Video file, which will later be used to extract the hidden message.

The practice of concealing messages or information within non-secret data, such as images or video files, to avoid detection is known as **Steganography**. This project facilitates the same. It provides the capability to _hide messages in image and video files_.

## How to use ?

- Get the repo code down to your work environment
- Install required Python libraries - `tkinter`, `os`, `numpy`, `termcolor`, `pyfiglet`, `cv2`, `pillow`
- Run any steganography file - `ImageStegano.py` or `VideoStegano.py`
- All the files that are going to be embedded are present in the `sample_files` folder. After embedding the message, the output file gets saved in the `Result_files` folder with the name `<file_name>_embedded`.

## Working Mechanism of Image Steganography

Image steganography involves concealing confidential messages within image files by altering the image's pixel data while preserving its visual integrity. This project facilitates encoding (embedding) and decoding (extracting) of secret messages within images through techniques such as Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding, Huffman coding, and Run Length Encoding.

By modifying the LSB of specific pixels (as it does not contribute much to image visual) and employing compression algorithms, the program seamlessly integrates hidden messages into images, ensuring minimal perceptible changes. Upon decoding, the hidden messages are extracted without compromising the image's appearance, thereby enabling secure communication through covert channels.

### Program Components

#### *Encoding*

1. **Input Acquisition**: The user selects an image file and inputs the message to be hidden within it.
2. **Text Compression**: The message is compressed using Huffman coding to reduce its size.
3. **LSB Encoding**: Each bit of the compressed message is sequentially embedded into the least significant bit of the image's pixel values. The embedding process slightly alters pixel values to encode the message without significantly altering the image's appearance.
4. **Output Generation**: The modified image is saved as a new file in the specified directory.

#### *Decoding*

1. **Input Acquisition**: The user selects the image containing the hidden message.
2. **LSB Extraction**: The LSB of each pixel in the image is extracted to reconstruct the binary representation of the hidden message.
3. **Text Decompression**: The extracted binary message is decompressed using Huffman decoding to retrieve the original message.
4. **Output Display**: The decoded message is displayed to the user.

## Working Mechanism of Video Steganography

Video steganography involves embedding secret data within video files without significantly affecting the video's visual and auditory quality. During the embedding process, the program first encrypts the data using a secure encryption algorithm to ensure confidentiality. Then, it divides the encrypted data into binary format and embeds it into the least significant bits (LSBs) of the RGB pixel values in each frame of the video. This process ensures that the changes made to the video are imperceptible to the human eye.

During extraction, the LSBs of the RGB pixel values in each frame are extracted, and the embedded data is reconstructed. Subsequently, the extracted data is decrypted using the same encryption key used during embedding, thereby retrieving the original secret message from the video. This combination of encryption and LSB embedding ensures both security and stealthiness in the process of embedding and extracting data from video files.

### Program Components

#### *Encryption*

1. **Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA)**: Generates the key stream based on the provided encryption key using the RC4 algorithm.
2. **Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA)**: Generates a pseudo-random sequence of bytes based on the key stream and the length of the plaintext.
3. **Encryption**: Encrypts the plaintext message using the key stream generated by PRGA.

#### *Encoding*

1. **Input Acquisition**: The user selects a video file, the data to be embedded, and an encryption key.
2. **Data Encryption**: The provided data is encrypted using the encryption function.
3. **LSB Encoding**: The encrypted data is embedded into the LSBs (Least Significant Bits) of the video frames. Each bit of the encrypted data is substituted for the LSB of the RGB pixel values.
4. **Output Generation**: The modified frames are written to a new video file, which is saved in the specified directory. Additionally, the secret frame is saved as a NumPy array in a text file with the same name as the embedded video.

#### *Decoding*

1. **Input Acquisition**: The user provides the required inputsâ€”embedded video, secret code, secret frame array, and frame number.
2. **Data Extraction**: The LSBs of the RGB pixel values are extracted from the video frames to reconstruct the encrypted data.
3. **Decryption**: The extracted encrypted data is decrypted using the same encryption key.
4. **Output Display**: The decrypted message is displayed to the user.

## User Interface

The program provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to perform various file steganography operations. Users can choose between encoding a message into a file or decoding a message from a file. The process continues until the user chooses to exit the program.

Additionally, the program utilizes the tkinter library in Python to present GUI dialogue boxes for selecting (opening) files, enhancing user convenience.
